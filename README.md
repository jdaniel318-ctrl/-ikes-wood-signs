# Ike's Wood Signs — Version 1.2

Version 1.2 keeps the Version 1 local-first ordering system and adds two major changes:

1. **In-app camera workflow.** The wood-photo step now uses `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` to show a live rear-camera view inside the ordering screen. The customer taps START CAMERA, TAKE PICTURE, then USE THIS PHOTO or RETAKE without leaving the 10-step flow. Captured photos are resized to a maximum 1600-pixel side and compressed before local storage.
2. **Stronger Ike's branding.** The welcome screen now uses the yellow/blue/red/green identity more heavily, includes the illustrated Ike character with a plank, and carries a smaller branded strip through the ordering experience.

## Important camera note
Direct camera access depends on the browser/container hosting the web app. Version 1.2 requests the rear camera directly and catches permission/support errors. For production, the app should run in Safari/PWA over a secure context or in a native wrapper that explicitly supports WebRTC camera access. HTML Serve can still be used to test whether its embedded browser grants this permission.

The saved-photo picker remains only as a testing fallback when the host blocks direct camera access; the intended customer workflow is the in-app camera.

## Local storage
Orders continue to be stored in IndexedDB on the device. Admin export/restore and order status tools remain unchanged.


## Version 1.3
- Automatic Web3Forms order submission (requires pasting the form Access Key into `WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY` in `app.js`).
- Unique customer order number is generated before submission and included in the email subject/body and confirmation screen.
- Customer-facing mail-app step removed.
- More illustrated Ike branding, softer organic shapes, fewer box-style panels.
- Live HTTPS camera workflow retained from Version 1.2.
- Orders remain stored locally in IndexedDB as a backup if automatic email fails.

### Required before publishing
Open `app.js` and replace:
`PASTE_WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY_HERE`
with the Access Key for the verified Web3Forms form whose recipient is `ikeswoodsigns.orders@yahoo.com`.
