# Dark Sky 4.9.3 — SIG Admin + Project Control Center Standard

## Signal Restoration repair
- Restores the Signal Restoration project-admin test baseline to the fleet-standard PIN `4353` once for this testing build, preventing stale project-local preview storage from blocking access.
- Keeps the repair project-scoped; other vessels' admin credentials are untouched.
- Adds a bundled fallback for the approved `signal_restoration_logo.png` on the project-admin gate when no project-local uploaded logo override exists.

## Project Control Center
- Adds an Overview-first Project Control Center to the protected project-admin experience.
- Adds project health, open workload, customer, recent-activity, isolation and system/build signals.
- Adds Signal Restoration-specific restoration operations, contact and Test/Private Preview safety status without leaking those business rules into other projects.
- Adapts quick stats to each project's workflow instead of assuming Ike-style production statuses.
- Preserves project-local orders, customers, settings, credentials and Test/Private Preview call restrictions.

# Dark Sky 4.9.2 — Signal Restoration Brand + Market Foundation

## Restoration project
- Rebrands the restoration vessel from the temporary Best Option/BOR concept to the original **Signal Restoration** brand.
- Uses the approved Signal Restoration logo asset.
- Project contact profile: `jdaniel318@gmail.com`, `804-317-3230`, `19600 Genito Rd`.
- Removes North Richmond / North Chesterfield positioning. Initial active market is Greater Richmond.
- Adds a project-local multi-market model so future Signal Restoration markets can have their own service area, phone, email, base address and deployment without creating cross-project data coupling.
- Keeps the legacy immutable project key internally for migration continuity; no BOR/Best Option identity is customer-facing.
- Request references now use the `SIG` prefix.

## Mobile + safety protections carried forward from 4.9.1
- Test/Private Preview call actions remain non-live and cannot place a real phone call.
- Live deployments use the new Signal Restoration number only.
- iPhone Engine keyboard scrolling and project-rail vertical gesture fixes are preserved.
- Dark Sky test navigation remains de-emphasized on mobile and can be removed entirely for standalone live deployments.

## Isolation
- Existing vessel definitions and Captain’s Quarters assets are not rebranded or modified by Signal Restoration.
- Signal Restoration brand/market migration updates only its canonical project row.
