# Dark Sky 8.8.14.10 — Owner Current

- Turned Ike’s Owner Orders from read-only cards into a clear authenticated operating surface.
- Added deliberate `MANAGE` → status workflow: New → In Production → Ready for Pickup → Completed.
- Added owner queue summary cards and durable save confirmation.
- A real owner status change now automatically publishes a bounded Watch signal immediately; no customer identity, wording, price, photos, or order details cross the bulkhead.
- Clarified authority: Engine may route into Owner Bridge, but only the verified exact-vessel owner session can modify the business. Return to Black Flag is navigation, not authority.
- Preserved Admiral read-only observability, six-member Fleet Core isolation, Bootstrap Build separation, full-frame viewport behavior, and manual Watch publishing.
